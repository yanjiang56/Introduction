# Introduction
## Hello!

I’m a high school student currently attending an international school in Shanghai, and I’m passionate about the intersection of finance and technology, particularly in the realm of stock market prediction using machine learning. While I’m only in Grade 10, I’ve been deeply engaged in projects that utilize advanced algorithms like LSTM, Random Forest, and XGBoost to predict stock prices, particularly focusing on Tesla’s stock. My work involves complex data preprocessing, feature engineering (with indicators like RSI, MACD, and VWAP), and model optimization techniques, all of which are aimed at refining predictive performance.

I’m not only focused on coding but also applying what I learn in practical scenarios, constantly working to improve trading strategies through simulation and analysis of key performance metrics such as annualized return, Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown. I aim to develop robust, real-world applicable trading systems while deepening my understanding of financial mathematics.

With a strong interest in algorithmic trading and a focus on professional-grade work, I’m always looking for opportunities to collaborate and improve my skills. Feel free to check out my repositories where I share my ongoing projects, and I’m open to feedback and discussions!
